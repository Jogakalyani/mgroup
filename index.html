        <h1>Proposed Enhancements for TrainWithUs</h1>
        <h2>Action Plan for Enhancing Training Administration at M Group Services</h2>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Enhancing Training Insights with Trend Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide managers with trend-based insights on training completion patterns.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Proposed Solution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement customizable dashboards that track completion rates, overdue tasks, and other key metrics. These dashboards could be set up with pivot tables to allow managers to filter data by department, time period, or specific training modules. Visual tools like graphs and charts (e.g., line graphs for trends, pie charts for completion rates) will make the data more accessible and easier to interpret at a glance.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image-placeholder">Dashboard Visual Placeholder (Pivot tables, charts, graphs)</div>
            <h3>Execution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work with LMS admins to set up automated monthly summaries and visual dashboards for quick reference. The dashboards will include interactive features where managers can drill down into specific metrics and get insights into team performance. This helps by offering an at-a-glance view of which teams are excelling and which may need more support, allowing for proactive management.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Streamlining Coordination with External Providers</h2>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve scheduling efficiency and reduce back-and-forth with external training providers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Proposed Solution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement a shared, real-time calendar accessible to external providers for booking. The calendar could use a color-coded system to indicate availability, booked slots, and pending approvals. By integrating with existing calendar tools (e.g., Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook), external providers could easily see open slots and request bookings without unnecessary email exchanges.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image-placeholder">Shared Calendar Example Placeholder (Color-coded calendar view)</div>
            <h3>Execution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborate with LMS or IT to set up a controlled-access calendar, ensuring transparency and coordination. Providers would be able to request bookings, which managers could approve or adjust directly within the system. This reduces administrative workload and keeps all stakeholders informed in real-time. The calendar could also integrate automated notifications for upcoming sessions, ensuring all parties are well-prepared.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image-placeholder">Shared Calendar with Booking Requests Example Placeholder</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Personalized Training Paths for Employee Engagement</h2>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase relevance and engagement by tailoring training modules to specific roles.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Proposed Solution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create personalized dashboards for employees, highlighting priority courses and certifications. The dashboard could display progress bars for ongoing training, upcoming deadlines, and specific role-based certifications, making it clear what each employee needs to focus on. This tailored view would help employees better understand their learning journey and stay motivated.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image-placeholder">Personalized Dashboard Example Placeholder (Progress bars, role-specific modules)</div>
            <h3>Execution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Organize courses by role and career path within LMS to provide employees a clear, relevant training path. Use a simple, visual layout to indicate completed modules and upcoming certifications. This will make it easier for employees to track their learning progress and for managers to support their development effectively.</li>
            </ul>
